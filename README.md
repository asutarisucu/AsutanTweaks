## Features
### LastUseCancel
>If you have only one item in your main hand you cannot use it.
### ItemRestock
>This is a feature implemented in [tweakeroo](https://github.com/maruohon/tweakeroo) as well, but when the hot bar is low on items, the items are replenished from the inventory.<br>
>The timing of replenishment can be changed by changing the `Restock Count`.<br>
>If `LastUseCancel` is enabled, it leaves one item in the inventory to be replenished.
### AutoFillInventory
>Pick up items from the container so that the count of items in the Player's inventory is maximized.
`LastUseCansel` and `ItemRestock` can be used together to replenish items without changing the structure of the items in the inventory.
This means you can always transport the optimal amount of items.
### DisableVoidDive
>When you try to fall into the Void, it automatically stops you from falling with fireworks.<br>
>For each dimension, the height at which it is recognized as void can be changed.
>Setting `VoidDisconnect` to True will automatically disconnect the game when there are no fireworks or elytra.
> Resuming the game, however, will not save your life.
